## Content Management
- Palette and typography are centralised in `tailwind.config.js` and `app/globals.css`.
- Homepage content (programmes, ecosystem, differentiators) is defined in `app/page.js`.
- Service offerings and acceleration layers live in `app/services/page.js`.
- Company narrative, leadership structures, and milestones are located in `app/about/page.js`.
- Contact information, regional desks, and collaboration guidance are maintained in `app/contact/page.js`.
- Insight articles reside in `content/posts.js`. Duplicate the existing structure to add new posts; each entry accepts HTML strings for rich formatting.

## Deployment
The site is production-ready with static optimisation for content pages. Deploy via your preferred platform (e.g. Vercel,
Netlify) by running:

```
and following the platform-specific deployment instructions.
