      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        BTC market depth across major Asian venues has normalised after the 2024 deleveraging cycle. We examine shifts in capital
        efficiency, the redistribution of liquidity, and the role of institutional market makers in stabilising spreads.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Liquidity concentration remains high on a few venues, but capital efficiency is improving through cross-margin frameworks.</li>
        <li>Structural leverage has moderated, reducing the frequency of liquidation cascades during overnight trading windows.</li>
        <li>Asia-led trading hours show rising influence on intraday volatility regimes as Western participation consolidates.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We continue to monitor funding spreads and cross-venue basis to quantify where liquidity providers are willing to warehouse
        risk and where pricing dislocations may emerge.

    content: `
      <h2>Signals to Systems</h2>
      <p>
        The integration of AI with systematic execution creates tighter feedback loops between research, decisioning, and trading.
        Institutions are redesigning research pipelines to capture differentiated data, apply adaptive models, and distribute
        insights into execution desks in near real-time.
      </p>
      <h3>Implications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster discovery of microstructure edges drives demand for governance around model deployment.</li>
        <li>Risk normalisation must account for automation across venues, assets, and counterparties.</li>
        <li>Data lineage and validation become competitive moats as regulatory standards evolve.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our advisory work focuses on aligning data, model oversight, and execution practices so that institutions can scale AI
        responsibly across market functions.

      <h2>Policy Catalysts</h2>
      <p>
        Regulators in Hong Kong, Singapore, the UAE, and the EU are refining licensing regimes that balance innovation with
        investor protection. These policy signals are creating clearer pathways for institutions to scale digital asset offerings.
      </p>
      <h3>What to Watch</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of interoperable custody standards that enable multi-jurisdictional operating models.</li>
        <li>Supervisory sandboxes evolving into permanent frameworks for tokenisation pilots.</li>
        <li>Capital treatment guidance that influences the pace of balance sheet deployment.</li>
      </ul>

        Aureon Capital monitors regulatory developments across a dozen jurisdictions, translating them into practical implications

    content: `
      <h2>Operating Priorities</h2>
      <p>
        Tokenised funds demand interoperability across issuance, custody, and secondary liquidity. Managers must coordinate
        technology stacks, service providers, and regulatory reporting from the outset of product design.
      </p>
      <h3>Implementation Checklist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Align issuance platforms with transfer agency and fund accounting requirements.</li>
        <li>Define contingency processes for settlement finality across on-chain and off-chain environments.</li>
        <li>Update governance charters to include digital asset risk metrics and incident response triggers.</li>

    content: `
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Institutional treasurers are increasingly accountable for demonstrating how digital asset exposure aligns with ESG
        commitments. This requires lifecycle transparency from energy usage to counterparty conduct.
      </p>
      <h3>Integration Levers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Adopt renewable-backed custody and staking providers with verifiable attestations.</li>
        <li>Embed sustainability KPIs within treasury policy, risk appetite, and reporting dashboards.</li>
        <li>Engage suppliers on provenance, sanctions screening, and social impact commitments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We help treasury teams translate ESG goals into procurement criteria, governance updates, and performance measurement for
        digital asset portfolios.
