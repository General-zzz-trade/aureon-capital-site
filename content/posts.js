### A New Era of Higher Inflation Risks
Investors face a structurally higher inflation regime than before COVID-19 — and most portfolios remain poorly equipped to handle it.

### The New Investment Environment
Today’s world is shaped by three powerful structural forces:

- Modern Mercantilism – Governments are playing an increasingly interventionist role in economies, prioritizing industrial policy and strategic security over efficiency and cost.
- Portfolio Concentration – Global capital is heavily concentrated in U.S. assets that are highly sensitive to inflation and tightening liquidity.
- Technological Transformation – The AI revolution is reshaping productivity, energy demand, and capital expenditure, creating both inflationary and deflationary forces.

Together, these dynamics imply a higher “resting heart rate” for inflation — where 2% becomes a floor rather than a ceiling.

### The Structural Shift Toward Inflation
1. Fiscal Expansion and State Activism
Governments across developed markets are running large deficits even in mid-cycle conditions. In the U.S., the fiscal deficit hovers near 7% of GDP. Persistent public spending — especially in less price-sensitive sectors like defense, social programs, and infrastructure — injects demand into economies already near capacity, driving price pressures and crowding out private investment.

2. Central Bank Independence Under Pressure
Political influence on monetary policy, particularly in the U.S., is eroding one of the key safeguards of inflation control. History shows that economies with weaker central-bank independence experience higher and more volatile inflation over time.

3. Deglobalization and Trade Realignment
The global trade system is being rewired. Tariffs, reshoring, and industrial policy mark a shift away from decades of deflationary globalization toward inflationary deglobalization. The cost of rebuilding domestic supply chains will be higher prices and lower efficiency — the price of “strategic resilience.”

4. Dollar Vulnerability
A potential decline in U.S. capital inflows, combined with lower real rates and fiscal stress, could trigger a structural dollar devaluation. Dollar weakness tends to coincide with commodity bull markets and imported inflation into the U.S. economy.

5. Inflation Psychology Returns
Once inflation expectations become embedded, firms and workers adapt — raising prices and wages more readily. This behavioral shift, seen in the 1970s, can turn one inflation wave into a recurring cycle.

### AI: Deflationary Promise, Inflationary Reality
Artificial Intelligence could unleash powerful disinflationary effects through productivity gains, automation, and cost efficiencies. Yet in the short run, it is doing the opposite: driving a surge in energy demand, data-center construction, and commodity consumption (copper, silver, uranium).

The outcome depends on whether productivity gains arrive fast enough to offset these pressures. Betting that AI alone will neutralize all structural inflation risks is, in Bridgewater’s words, “a speculative wager with poor risk-reward.”

### Portfolio Implications: Traditional Models Are Vulnerable
The post-COVID inflation shock shattered a long-held belief: that stocks and bonds reliably hedge each other. Rising inflation flipped their correlation positive, causing simultaneous drawdowns and exposing the fragility of traditional 70/30 portfolios.

History confirms that roughly half of all major 70/30 drawdowns since the 1960s occurred during inflation spikes that forced liquidity tightening. Even when nominal returns looked positive, real returns were often deeply negative once inflation erosion was factored in.

### Positioning for a Higher-Inflation World
Bridgewater’s analysis suggests investors should rethink portfolio construction through a Total Portfolio Approach, ensuring exposure across environments — growth, inflation, and liquidity.

### Key Takeaways
- Diversify beyond U.S. equities and Treasuries.
- Incorporate inflation-resilient assets such as commodities, real assets, and inflation-linked bonds.
- Recognize that inflation protection is currently cheap relative to the risk of sustained inflation shocks.

### Bottom Line
We are not entering a “new inflation” era so much as returning to a historical norm — one where inflation risks are ever-present and macro volatility higher. The deflationary calm of the 2010s was an anomaly.

In this new cycle, policymakers are more active, markets more concentrated, and inflation more structural. Investors who continue to rely on old paradigms risk seeing their real returns eroded in silence.

    excerpt: "Assessing exchange depth, basis spreads, and regional market structure as Asia re-prices liquidity and leverage.",

### Overview
We examine BTC liquidity across major Asian venues, focusing on depth-of-book, funding rates, and basis dynamics.

### Key Takeaways
- Liquidity concentration remains high on a few venues, but capital efficiency is improving.
- Structural leverage has moderated, reducing the frequency of liquidation cascades.
- Asia-led trading hours show rising influence on intraday volatility regimes.

### Signals to Systems
The integration of AI with systematic execution creates tighter feedback loops between research and trading.

### Implications
- Faster discovery of microstructure edges.
- Increased need for risk normalization across venues and instruments.
- Governance standards become a competitive moat.
