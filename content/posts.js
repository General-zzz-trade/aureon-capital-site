      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        BTC market depth across major Asian venues has normalised after the 2024 deleveraging cycle. We examine shifts in capital
        efficiency, the redistribution of liquidity, and the role of institutional market makers in stabilising spreads.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Liquidity concentration remains high on a few venues, but capital efficiency is improving through cross-margin frameworks.</li>
        <li>Structural leverage has moderated, reducing the frequency of liquidation cascades during overnight trading windows.</li>
        <li>Asia-led trading hours show rising influence on intraday volatility regimes as Western participation consolidates.</li>
      </ul>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        We continue to monitor funding spreads and cross-venue basis to quantify where liquidity providers are willing to warehouse
        risk and where pricing dislocations may emerge.

    excerpt: "How model-driven signals and automation are reshaping pricing, execution, and risk in digital asset markets.",
    content: `
      <h2>Signals to Systems</h2>
      <p>
        The integration of AI with systematic execution creates tighter feedback loops between research, decisioning, and trading.
        Institutions are redesigning research pipelines to capture differentiated data, apply adaptive models, and distribute
        insights into execution desks in near real-time.
      </p>
      <h3>Implications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster discovery of microstructure edges drives demand for governance around model deployment.</li>
        <li>Risk normalisation must account for automation across venues, assets, and counterparties.</li>
        <li>Data lineage and validation become competitive moats as regulatory standards evolve.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our advisory work focuses on aligning data, model oversight, and execution practices so that institutions can scale AI
        responsibly across market functions.

      <h2>Policy Catalysts</h2>
      <p>
        Regulators in Hong Kong, Singapore, the UAE, and the EU are refining licensing regimes that balance innovation with
        investor protection. These policy signals are creating clearer pathways for institutions to scale digital asset offerings.
      </p>
      <h3>What to Watch</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementation of interoperable custody standards that enable multi-jurisdictional operating models.</li>
        <li>Supervisory sandboxes evolving into permanent frameworks for tokenisation pilots.</li>
        <li>Capital treatment guidance that influences the pace of balance sheet deployment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Aureon Capital monitors regulatory developments across a dozen jurisdictions, translating them into practical implications
        for operating models, product design, and risk management.

      <h2>Market Context</h2>
      <p>
        Institutional adoption of tokenised collateral platforms is accelerating as clearing houses and custodians pilot
        interoperable solutions. We analyse the operational benefits, integration risks, and governance requirements that
        accompany these deployments.
      </p>
      <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Collateral velocity improvements through programmability and real-time settlement.</li>
        <li>Risk considerations around smart contract resilience and counterparty transparency.</li>
        <li>Opportunities for capital optimisation when linking traditional prime brokerage with on-chain infrastructure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Institutions should prioritise interoperability standards, stress testing, and coordinated change management to ensure
        tokenised collateral programs deliver sustainable value.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Digital asset operating models expose institutions to continuous attack surfaces spanning wallets, APIs, and cross-border
        data flows. Cyber resilience must be embedded across people, process, and technology from day one.
      </p>
      <h3>Control Themes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement zero-trust principles with continuous authentication and privileged access management.</li>
        <li>Conduct tabletop exercises simulating custody breaches, exchange downtime, and protocol vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Align regulatory reporting, incident response, and insurance coverage to accelerate recovery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our cyber specialists collaborate with clients to benchmark controls, orchestrate remediation sprints, and establish
        resilience metrics that satisfy boards and regulators alike.
